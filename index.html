            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my portfolio website! Here you can find out whatever you need to know about me and take a look at my achievements!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a passionate computer engineering student at the University of South Florida currently in my second year of school. I am extremely interested in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning technologies and hope to one day be involved in this field. I have decent experience in mobile application development that I aquired from an internship I did during the summer of 2023. I have also been learning important topics such as Data Structures and algorithms during my free time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love to be involved on campus and demonstrate my leadership and interpersonal skills. That's why I have been working as an intramural sports official for USF Campus Recreation for the past two semesters. I have been successful in this position thanks to my experience as an assistant coach and team captain of an Archery team during my high school years.
