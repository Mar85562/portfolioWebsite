            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you can get a closer look at my journey as a computer engineering student at the University of South Florida and discover the projects and passions that drive me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently in my third year and have a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and hardware. With experience from a summer 2023 internship, I developed a mobile portal for construction workers using Flutter. I am also actively involved in the Society of Aeronautics and Rocketry (SOAR), where I contribute to projects involving control systems, data acquisition systems, and RF control systems to support our liquid propulsion rocket engine development efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I enjoy deepening my understanding of Data Structures and algorithms, and I am currently exploring robotics topics such as rigid body transformations and forward kinematics. I also work as a mail and desk clerk for USF Housing & Residential Education, where I have built strong interpersonal and organizational skills while assisting fellow students.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I am excited to share my accomplishments and connect with others who share my interests.

                    <h3>Liquid Propulsion Rocket Engine</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">This is a student-led liquid propulsion rocket engine designed to produce 250LB of thrust. As the EECS Lead, I manage the integration of electronic systems, including load cells for thrust measurement, pressure and temperature sensors, and RF systems for remote ignition and monitoring. This project allows me to apply my skills in control systems, embedded systems, and sensor integration in a hands-on, collaborative environment</p>

                    <h3>Personalized AI Study Companion</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">This Personalized Study Companion is an AI-driven tool I created to help users study smarter by offering tailored recommendations and tracking their progress. Using Python, Flask, and Streamlit, I built this project to analyze study materials with NLP and provide insights through interactive visualizations. It is all about making learning more efficient and engaging, and it reflects my passion for combining AI with practical, user-focused solutions.</p>

                    <h3>Calendar App</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">This is an app I developed during my Summer 2023 internship at Hassan Allam Technologies. It's main purpose is to give employees more access such as notifications about upcoming events, requesting sick leave and signing-in and out. I did it's implementation completely individually using the flutter mobile development environment. The links below show more about the project, however, it is still in progress and I will still add more functionalities and complete the intended purpose. The app is not yet deployed so the google drive link below contains snapshots of development progress as well as videos of the app's functionalities.</p>

                    <h3>News App</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">This is a fully-functional news app I developed using APIs and the flutter development environment. It has theme changes such as switching from light to dark mode. It also updates and refreshes to get the latest news thanks to the integration of APIs into the app. The app is complete but not deployed so the google drive link below shows snapshots from its testing and development progress. Its github link is in the other projects section below.</p>
