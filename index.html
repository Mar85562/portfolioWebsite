            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
               Welcome to my portfolio! I am Marwan Abdelwahab, a Computer Engineering student at the University of South Florida passionate about building intelligent, reliable, and efficient computing systems that bridge hardware design, embedded software, and artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently serve as the Electronics Team Lead for the Society of Aeronautics and Rocketry (SOAR), where I lead the design and integration of real-time data acquisition and control systems for a student-built liquid rocket engine. My work spans FreeRTOS firmware development in C++, sensor interfacing, and custom PCB design, enabling reliable telemetry and control under demanding test conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
               At the SEES Lab, I conduct research on Generative AI for hardware design, developing large language model-based methods for automating RTL code generation and verification. My current focus is on building a hierarchical Verilog dataset for benchmarking AI-assisted circuit design and evaluating performance, power, and area trade-offs using Yosys, OpenLane, and the Sky130 PDK.
            </p>
            <p>
                Previously, I designed a RISC-V SoC with a machine learning accelerator, integrating a custom coprocessor and producing a DRC/LVS-clean GDSII layout as part of my ASIC design research.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside research, I work as a Teaching Assistant for Computer Logic & Design, mentoring over 100 students in Verilog, digital design, and simulation workflows. I also serve as an Operations Assistant for USF Housing & Residential Education, where I strengthen my organizational and communication skills by managing equipment logistics and student support tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Driven by curiosity and precision, I aim to advance in the intersection of embedded systems, AI-driven hardware design, and digital system optimization—building the technologies that connect intelligent software with efficient hardware.

                    <h3>Generative AI for Hardware Design</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">At the Secure, Efficient & Evolvable Systems (SEES) Lab at the University of South Florida, I conduct research on Generative AI for hardware design under the supervision of Dr. Hao Zheng. My work explores how large language models (LLMs) can automate the generation and verification of hardware description language (HDL) code, accelerating the design process for digital systems. I am currently developing a hierarchical Verilog dataset containing 50–70 designs of varying complexity to benchmark and evaluate the performance of State-of-the-Art LLMs in RTL code generation. This research also involves analyzing performance, power, and area (PPA) trade-offs using tools such as Yosys, OpenLane, and the Sky130 PDK, with the goal of advancing AI-assisted design automation and creating reproducible benchmarks for future EDA research.</p>

                    <h3>Liquid Propulsion Rocket Engine</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">This project involves the design and testing of a student-built liquid rocket engine capable of generating 250 lb of thrust. 
                        As the Electronics & Computer Systems Lead, I oversee the development and integration of all electronic subsystems — including load cells for thrust measurement, pressure and temperature sensors, and RF-based remote ignition and telemetry systems.
                        I design and implement real-time control and data acquisition firmware using FreeRTOS on ESP32 microcontrollers, ensuring reliable communication, safety interlocks, and synchronized sensor logging. This role combines embedded systems, control engineering, and sensor integration, providing hands-on experience in system reliability, hardware-software co-design, and cross-disciplinary collaboration within a fast-paced engineering team.</p>

                    <p class="project-description">This project involved designing a 24x24-bit array multiplier using CMOS technology and Carry Save Adders (CSAs) to optimize performance while minimizing area constraints (751.95 µm x 891.65 µm). Using Cadence Virtuoso, I developed a hierarchical layout, incorporating signal boosters and bus bars to ensure power distribution and signal integrity across the chip. The design underwent DRC and LVS validation, ensuring manufacturability and compliance with CMOS fabrication standards. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in VLSI design, circuit simulation, and hardware optimization.</p>

                    <h3>Calendar App</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">This is an app I developed during my Summer 2023 internship at Hassan Allam Technologies. It's main purpose is to give employees more access such as notifications about upcoming events, requesting sick leave and signing-in and out. I did it's implementation completely individually using the flutter mobile development environment. The links below show more about the project, however, it is still in progress and I will still add more functionalities and complete the intended purpose. The app is not yet deployed so the google drive link below contains snapshots of development progress as well as videos of the app's functionalities.</p>

                    <p class="project-description">This is a fully-functional news app I developed using APIs and the flutter development environment. It has theme changes such as switching from light to dark mode. It also updates and refreshes to get the latest news thanks to the integration of APIs into the app. The app is complete but not deployed so the google drive link below shows snapshots from its testing and development progress.
